<h4><em>Cosmic Hero</em> - Car Seat Headrest</h4>
<p><em>Cosmic Hero</em> provided my favorite moment of the year, screaming its bridge in the car with my oldest friend. It is a song of catharsis and while I connect to it on a personal level, it is also a sigificant political message. After the election many critised the reaction of the left, telling them to 'wait and see'. Toledo's response to this is to say, no - sometimes everything won't be alright.</p>

<h4><em>True Love Waits</em>/<em>Present Tense</em> — Radiohead</h4>
<p>This pair of tracks might have taken the top spot on this list if I could bare to listen to them more often. Both tracks deal with Yorke’s separation from his partner of 23 years in different ways, one through attempting distraction, the other through harrowing honesty. <em>True Love Waits</em> gets the top billing here, if only because it is one of Yorke’s best vocal performances ever, begging a lover 'just don’t leave', knowing full well she is already gone. </p>

<h4><em>Untitled 2 (Blue Faces)</em> Live at Jimmy Fallon — Kendrick Lamar </h4>
<p>Kendrick Lamar’s live performances this year were absolutely masterful. While his performance at the Grammy’s was more politically significant, it did not give us an entire new song to digest (only a new verse). This performance did, and gave us one of my favorite lyrics of 2016 'A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me/see I made my moves with shackled feet'. Unfortunately Lamar’s level of energy here was never matched by the album which the performance later spawned, <em>untitled unmastered</em>. </p>

<h4><em>Self Control</em>/<em>Nights</em> — Frank Ocean</h4>
<p>My favorite pair of tracks off of Frank’s <em>Blonde</em>, they paint a portrait of a man who is filled with regret and nostalgia for past relationships and times.</p>

<h4><em>Lazarus</em> — David Bowie</h4>
<p>My favorite track off of Bowie’s final album. Lazarus sees Bowie dealing with his life’s end and the terror that he faces in his final days. It is eerie but at the same time beautiful as he tries to persuade himself that with death comes freedom. For listeners the jazz backing inspires freedom, mourning, and finality.</p>

<h4><em>I Need You</em> — Skeleton Tree</h4>
<p>Another track that might be higher if I could bare to listen to it more often, <em>I Need You</em> is a father desperately trying to deal with the death of his son. The anguish in Cave's voice more than makes up for the songs reliance on cliche lyrics like 'I Need You' and 'Nothing Really Matters' and the result is heartbreaking. </p>

<h4><em>8 Circle</em> — Bon Iver</h4>
<p>The most complete track on <em>22, a Million</em> with a nice build and a great use of vocal effects. Admittedly, this track is probably the most similar to Bon Ives’s prior work, but I think it is also one of most immediate tracks on an album that often keeps the listener at an arms-length.</p>

<h4><em>Don’t Touch My Hair</em> — Solange</h4>
<p>Putting this over <em>Cranes in the Sky</em> will probably draw ire from many, but the fact remains I like this track more. I enjoy hearing the pride in Solange’s voice and the rejection of the microagressions and racist remarks that are often directed at black women.</p>

<h4><em>E.V.P.</em>/<em>Better Numb</em> — Blood Orange</h4>
<p>The chorus on E.V.P. has a soaring, overflowing quality that very few others can match. However, it is when this chorus comes back, quietly and in a different context on the last track that its meaning is revealed and the impact of the lines 'Do you ever think boy / or does it just feel better numb' is fully realized.</p>

<h4><em>Hallucinations</em> — DVSN </h4>
<p>A smooth track that makes loss sound so good. </p>
